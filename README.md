### ü§î What is this service?
Wolf Incubator provides automatic feeding for your Wolf NFTs to prevent them from starving. This is a service for the SHEEP game on Sonic, but we are not affiliated with or endorsed by the game's creators.

### ‚öôÔ∏è How does Wolf Incubator work?
Our service keeps an eye on your wolves. When they get hungry, we automatically feed them using the SHEEP tokens they would normally earn. This ensures they never starve! After feeding, we handle the process of collecting the rewards, take a small service fee, and send the rest directly to your wallet.

### üõ°Ô∏è Is this service secure?
Absolutely. When you authorize Wolf Incubator, you're only giving our smart contract permission to perform the feeding action on your behalf. We never gain control of your Wolf NFTs or other assets. You can view our verified contract code on SonicScan for full transparency, and you can revoke the authorization at any time, instantly stopping the service.
